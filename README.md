# Clothing Store Website
The main page of a fake clothing store website made for an university assignment. The website is responsive with a seperate designs for mobile and desktop screen resolutions. Most of the website is static with the exception of the clothing item sections. The clothing items are taken from the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/). Furthermore, there is a working searchbar that filters the clothing items. You can view [the live webpage here](https://lukatsanavabtu.github.io/clothing-store-website/).

## What I Practiced While Working On The Project
- Responsive design;
- Animations and transitions;
- `object-fit` and `object-position`;
- Fetching data from an API and dynamically populating a webpage;
- Implementing a searchbar.
